## Description
Just Tech Newsâ€”a tech news website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Just Tech News uses Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and the application is connected to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.

## Skills Acquired
- Configure the Sequelize ORM in a Node.js application.
- Create models for categories, products, and tags in a relational database and a through table that will connect the product and tag models.
- Define and implement CRUD methods, using Sequelize to interact with your models in each API endpoint through proper RESTful commands (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Create and implement Sequelize associations to join tables.
- Use environment variables to protect sensitive data, such as your MySQL username and password.
